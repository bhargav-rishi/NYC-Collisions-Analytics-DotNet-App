## Overview
We have built a dynamic web application that provides insights into motor vehicle collisions across New York City using MVC architecture and API-based data management to leverage publicly available data which supports the analysis of collision frequency and their impact on public safety.​

The project was developed as part of the Application Development for Analytics course at the **University of South Florida - Muma College of Business**

## Objectives
- Develop a dynamic web application using the MVC architecture.
- Leverage API-based data management for real-time insights.
- Provide a user-friendly dashboard for analyzing collision frequency and patterns in NYC.
- Support public safety initiatives through accessible data visualization.

## Key Features
- **MVC Architecture**: Built using ASP.NET Core with separation of concerns.
- **API Integration**: Real-time collision data fetched using external APIs.
- **Singleton Service**: Used to ensure consistent data management across the application.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality implemented.
- **Dashboard Visualizations**: Interactive charts and tables for analyzing trends.
- **Azure Deployment**: Deployed on Microsoft Azure for accessibility.
